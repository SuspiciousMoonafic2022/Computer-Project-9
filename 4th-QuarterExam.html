            "This took me a while to choose because i was <br>
            having trouble deciding which memorable picture <br>
            i want to show, this is me and my friends way <br>
            back 2020, we were about to celebrate New Years <br>
            2021 and honestly, it was such a fun time. <br>
            2020 was a time when people were desperate to <br>
            find something to do because of how boring the <br>
            quarantine was, for me it was meeting new online <br>
            friends, and specifically, this minecraft server. <br>
            We had alot of fun times in this server, online friends <br>
            were such a huge part of my 2020 that every screenshot <br>
            i have is considered memorable, this picture was like <br>
            one of the last photos we took together before we left <br>
            the server forever, well we are still friends anyway <br>
            ....some of us." <br>
